<p>This will be interesting. Official results of the experiment are to be published in 2019.</p>
<p>The push for a universal basic income comes from economically skeptical left-leaning millennials, and industrialists who see in workforce automation their answer to the problems of human labor — the need to provision, maintain, scale, and accommodate large numbers of comparatively inefficient workers, with all of their troubles and demands. Widespread automation would allow for an even greater profit efficiency than <em>slavery</em>, without any of the associated ethical considerations — provided, of course, that the masses of dispossessed workers are maintained in a kind of minimally acceptable lifestyle.</p>
