Hi, I'm Toby, and [Tobybase](http://tobybase.com/) is my professional blog. I update from time to time when I run across problems or solutions that I think might be of interest to people. I try not to keep too much of the good stuff to myself. I'm an Oracle developer and database performance analyst by trade, and for the last few years I've been working primarily on the [Exadata](https://www.oracle.com/engineered-systems/exadata/) platform, a specialty database machine developed by [Oracle](http://oracle.com/) that changes the ordinary rules of the game for performance tuning. I enjoy exploring [new technologies](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/index.html) and [learning new things](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images). I work at [Infolob](http://infolob.com/), an Oracle consultancy and Platinum Partner in Irving, Texas, with some of the [best folks](https://www.infolob.com/leader-profile/tim-fox/) in the business. I love my job and my work. Who knows, maybe I can help you someday.
