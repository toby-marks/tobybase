> AnyConnect cannot confirm it is connected to your secure gateway.  The local network may not be trustworthy.  Please try another network.

This is a potentially misleading explanation, as the problem in my case was due to a corrupted VPN certificate. 

To fix the problem on macOS, do the following.

1.  Open Keychain.app and search for a certificate for your VPN. If you already have one, export it to create a backup in case you need to restore, then delete the certificate in Keychain.

2.  Point a browser to https://vpn.yourcompany.com, or whatever the address of VPN happens to be.

3.  The certificate should automatically download to Keychain at this point. If the certificate is self-signed, you will get a warning. If that is the case, you will need to download the certificate yourself (click on Advancedâ€¦ / View Certificate or something similar in your browser of choice). Once downloaded, double clicking the certificate should open it in Keychain.app.

4.  View your certificate in Keychain. Expand the `Trust` section and select `Always Trust`. Save your Keychain.

Now try connecting once again from AnyConnect, and hopefully that fixes your problem.
