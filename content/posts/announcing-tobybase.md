Welcome one and all to my new professional blog, [tobybase.com](http://tobybase.com/ "Redirects to the website you are now on"). My name is Toby Marks and I work as a [Oracle](http://oracle.com "Oracle's website") Consultant at [Infolob Solutions](http://infolob.com/ "My company's website") in [Irving, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Colinas "Some info about sunny Las Colinas"). My [old blog](http://tjmoracle.tumblr.com/ "My old blog") is still up on [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com/ "Go to Tumblr"), and there are a [few](https://tmblr.co/Z9fAmvZapPzC "Create PDF Reports in Oracle Apex") [items](https://tmblr.co/Z9fAmvXEB6iL "Query an XML File Like an External Table") [there](https://tmblr.co/Z9fAmvOFEN-N "OS X Software for Oracle Developers") that folks still find useful. Most of the content is a bit dated, though, as I've been out of the blogging game for a while. 

This is my attempt to turn that around. 

What I needed was a breath of technological fresh air. Something to excite me about blogging again. So as a personal challenge, and in the spirit of adopting the latest and greatest platforms, I have decided to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io "Hugo makes blogging fun again") for static web page generation. I wanted to provide a site with the fastest possible page load times by maintaining maximum control over coding and site customization. I also love the immediate feedback Hugo gives you while you're coding a page. No more precious seconds lost on Wordpress or Blogger! The site will be hosted on my [Github](https://github.com/toby-marks "My Github repository"), which will provide me with version control and an easy method for synchronization with the web server. 

I hope you enjoy the new site. I look forward to adding some interesting content over the coming weeks.
