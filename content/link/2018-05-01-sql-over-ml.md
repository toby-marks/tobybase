> I will write a query like select from order table where last shop date is 3 or greater months. When we get this information, we will send a nice "we miss you, come back and here's X Naira voucher" email. The conversation rate for this one was always greater than 50%.

So-called artificial intelligence and machine learning tools are in fashion these days, and the impetus is to apply them to all problem sets. It would be a mistake to think that they *should*, or even *could*, substitute for rational thought and human insight. Most problems are simple, and do not require complex systems to solve. (I've been surprised upon learning how commonsensical are the actual rules that inform predictive analyses, recommendation engines, and relationship graphs.) Good business analysis yields teachable results, not "magic" numbers or inscrutable algorithms. Human intelligence should not be set aside when pursuing the benefits of machine intelligence.
