> If the tactical tasks are reduced -- or even eliminated -- DBAs will have more time to spend on higher level tasks, like data security, data lifecycle management, data architecture and data modeling, Colgan said.

I can't be too worried about automation replacing the need for database professionals. The first time I recall hearing such claims was in 1999 with the advent of Oracle 9i. If what Colgan says is true, and there is every reason to believe it is, then the day to day work of DBAs and consultants like myself is only bound to become more interesting and productive. All of those things she mentions — particularly security — deserve far more attention than they receive in most organizations, as underfunded and overwhelmed as they are with routine operational tasks.
