      <title>&#39;Invalid Format&#39; Error Connecting to Server with SSH and Private Key</title>

      <description>If you get an &amp;lsquo;invalid format&amp;rsquo; error when trying to SSH in to a remote server using a private key file that you know is valid, it may be because the key was generated with PuTTY.
If the key begins with PuTTY-User-Key-File and you are using SSH/openSSH (ie. command line SSH) to connect to your server, you will need to first convert the key file using the puttygen tool that comes with PuTTY.</description>

      <title>Enable OCI Thick Client Connections in SQL Developer on Windows</title>
      <link>http://tobybase.com/posts/enable-oci-connections-in-sql-developer/</link>

      <description>Jeff Smith has an excellent article on how to enable OCI Thick Client connections in SQL Developer, and all the reasons you might want to. For me, it all comes down to the ability to cancel a running query or process in a timely manner. The &amp;ldquo;hang&amp;rdquo; normally associated with canceling JDBC-based thin client connections is pretty unacceptable. With thick client you get the same level of responsiveness as you would in a console SQL*Plus session.</description>

      <description>(The following is adapted from the official Photon OS FAQ.)
How do I transfer or share files between #Photon and my host machine? Use vmhgfs-fuse to transfer files between Photon and your host machine:
  Enable Shared folders in the Workstation or Fusion UI (edit the VM settings and choose Options-&amp;gt;Enabled shared folders).
  Make sure open-vm-tools is installed (it is installed by default in the Minimal installation and OVA import).</description>

      <title>Translating Teradata&#39;s MDIFF Function to Oracle SQL</title>

      <guid>http://tobybase.com/posts/translating-mdiff-to-oracle/</guid>
      <description>Teradata defines its MDIFF function as follows:
 MDIFF
Returns the moving difference between the specified value expression for the current row and the preceding width rows for each row in the partition.
 Here &amp;ldquo;the preceding width rows&amp;rdquo; means something like the preceding n rows, where n is sometimes interpreted as the sum of all of the preceding rows, but generally as the value of the last row.
Teradata&amp;rsquo;s docs also has this to say about MDIFF:</description>

      <description>You might not know this, but you can use the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE command with a CLOB, the same as with a VARCHAR2 variable.
declare l_sql clob; l_str1 varchar2(32767); l_str2 varchar2(32767); begin dbms_lob.createtemporary(l_sql, false); l_str1 := &amp;#39;some large SQL chunk&amp;#39;; l_str2 := &amp;#39;and the rest of large SQL chunk&amp;#39;; l_sql := l_str1; dbms_lob.writeappend(l_sql, length(l_str2), l_str2); execute immediate l_sql; dbms_lob.freetemporary(l_sql); end; </description>

      <description>I originally had this requirement after creating a new persistent linux virtual machine in OVM that needed static addressing. This is just standard linux setup, though, and can be adapted to both virtual and physical machines.
Turn on Networking # sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network Make sure networking is enabled and configure the hostname.
NETWORKING=yes HOSTNAME=myhost.mycompany.local Configure the Network Interface # sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 Here is a sample config for static IPs.</description>

      <description>Get the hash of the &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; version you want to recover You first need to identify where things went wrong. Then get the commit identifier (also called the hash) for the version immediately prior to that. (Also make sure you&amp;rsquo;re pulling from the appropriate branch; for simplicity&amp;rsquo;s sake, this example assumes all changes are being committed to the master branch.)

      <description>The easiest and fastest way to query and create data in your new cloud database is with SQL Developer Web, provided free with every new instance of Autonomous Database and Autonomous Data Warehouse in the Cloud. Second fastest would be with a local installation of SQL Developer or SQLcl. But if you want an authentic SQL*Plus environment, then you&amp;rsquo;ll need Oracle Instant Client.
You have two options for running SQL*Plus under Instant Client: download and install a platform-native version, or else run Instant Client in a Docker container.</description>

SQL Developer Web is a scaled down version of the desktop tool that allows you to query and enter data, run scripts, compile database objects, and monitor and administrate your database.</description>

      <title>3 Tips for Running SAS Queries on Oracle</title>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know a whole lot about SAS, but on my current gig I am frequently called upon to tune queries that run in that environment. Here are three things I have learned to keep in mind as a SAS developer when running against Oracle database.
Use PRESERVE_COMMENTS This is most critical. In Oracle, SQL hints are specified in a specially formatted inline comment. Running a query or DML statement without those hints could be detrimental to performance.</description>

      <title>Fix High CPU Usage / Memory Leak in SQL Developer 18&#43; for Windows</title>

      <description>If you run SQL Developer on Windows and experience high CPU usage and/or memory leak issues that freeze your PC, then you might want to try disabling some features that are likely causing the problem.
I have personally observed this behavior on every version of SQL Developer since 18.2. Only my PC laptop is affected; my Macbook installation runs fine. I use the prepackaged Java 8 JDK. I have several colleagues who run the same configuration on Windows with no issues at all, so go figure.</description>

      <description>In recent years, a growing number of tech entrepreneurs have endorsed universal basic income (UBI), a system system in which every individual receives a standard amount of money, simply for being alive.
 And‚Ä¶
 These tech moguls recognize that UBI, as well as combatting poverty, could also help solve the problem of increased robotization in the workforce, a problem they are very much part of creating.
 This will be interesting.</description>

      <description>If the tactical tasks are reduced &amp;ndash; or even eliminated &amp;ndash; DBAs will have more time to spend on higher level tasks, like data security, data lifecycle management, data architecture and data modeling, Colgan said.
 I can&amp;rsquo;t be too worried about automation replacing the need for database professionals. The first time I recall hearing such claims was in 1999 with the advent of Oracle 9i. If what Colgan says is true, and there is every reason to believe it is, then the day to day work of DBAs and consultants like myself is only bound to become more interesting and productive.</description>

      <description>While Facebook remains the biggest platform, Google and Twitter are facing similar pressure from governments in the U.S. and in Europe. Germany enacted a law requiring the social networks to remove hate speech promptly or face fines. In the U.S., the activities of a Russian troll farm during the 2016 election campaign prompted scrutiny of Facebook&amp;rsquo;s ad selling practices and a (rather ham-handed) legislative attempt to force some transparency.</description>

      <description>If you use Juniper&amp;rsquo;s Network Connect app to connect to your office VPN over HTTPS, you might occasionally experience strange errors like &amp;ldquo;A software error caused the Network Connect tunneling service to terminate.&amp;rdquo; Shortly after that, the application may either crash or prompt you for login credentials again.
The solution involves removing all of the Network Connect files and allowing your browser to download and install the app all over again, as it did the first time you tried to connect to your office VPN.</description>

      <description>The ps command is a versatile and configurable way to look at the processes running on your system, though I&amp;rsquo;ve generally gotten by with a lazy ps -ef to find out whatever I needed to know. Recently, though, a client&amp;rsquo;s server began running out of memory, and as a number of processes were running on the server, the culprit was not immediately clear. I wanted to provide them with a quick, simple diagnostic tool they could use the next time they received an alert.</description>

      <description>I just purchased a new Macbook Pro 13-inch with Retina Display and was horrified to see how fuzzy SQL Developer looked on the high-res screen. Thanks to Thunderforge on the Stack Overflow forums for this tip:
 Java 7u40 Early Access now supports HiDPI (Retina) displays, as shown by this changelog. So retina support is now available on Java 6, Java 7u40 or higher, and Java 8.
 I am currently running the Early Adopter release of SQL Developer 4.</description>

      <title>How To Reset Page Numbering Between Document Sections in BI Publisher&#39;s Template Builder for Word</title>

      <description>Under normal circumstances, it is fairly easy in Microsoft Word to reset page numbering when starting a new section of your document. However, such a simple thing can be non-trivial when dealing with the BI Publisher Template Builder plugin for Microsoft Office (available from Oracle ‚Äî see BI Publisher Desktop).
In short, doing this the normal way did not work for me, and in researching the issue I ran across a number of folks who were having the same problem.</description>

      <description>In Windows, most applications provide menu and button accelerator keys that allow you to control the application without having to use a mouse. Java Swing apps like SQL Developer allow you to do the same, ostensibly in a cross-platform compatible manner.
One place I use this frequently is the Enter Binds dialog window that pops up when running a query using bind variables.
In Java 6 on OS X, the hotkey for pressing the Help and Apply buttons was OPTION-H and OPTION-A, respectively.</description>

      <description>Oracle&amp;rsquo;s external table feature allows you to treat structured files on the database server as tables for query and DML purposes. To use an example from the linked documentation, a tab-delimited file like this:
56 november, 15, 1980 baker mary alice 09/01/2004 87 december, 20, 1970 roper lisa marie 01/01/1999  &amp;hellip;could be queried like this:
SELECT employee_number, employee_first_name, substr(employee_middle_name, 1, 1), employee_last_name, employee_hire_date, to_date(employee_dob,&amp;#39;month, dd, yyyy&amp;#39;) FROM employees; After defining the external table like this:</description>

      <description>In my last post I described how to configure BI Publisher to authenticate against an LDAP server, typically a corporate Active Directory server. Aside from authentication, you can also use LDAP group membership to determine who has access to a given report. Here&amp;rsquo;s how you do it.
  Create a group in your LDAP/AD directory and assign your target users to that group.
  Revisit your LDAP authentication settings.</description>

I was looking for a way to list all the properties of a generic Javascript or DOM object when I stumbled across this blog post by Andrew Peters.</description>

      <description>You can get this error if you are trying to schedule a report and your BI Publisher installation uses LDAP authentication.
To avoid it, make sure that the &amp;ldquo;Administrator&amp;rdquo; account you use to connect to your LDAP server is in the XMLP_ADMIN group. The LDAP settings are located on the Admin tab, under Security Settings / Security Configuration.</description>

Usually the progress indicator would either flash momentarily and do nothing, or else it would never appear at all.

I switched to Chrome as my default browser for a few days, but that was about all I could stand.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been fighting for a couple of years now with an annoying performance bug in SQL Developer for OS X. After using the application for a while CPU usage would spike to around 100%, even when idle. This is a known issue associated with the &amp;ldquo;Look and Feel&amp;rdquo; preference.
Basically, don&amp;rsquo;t use the &amp;ldquo;Mac OS X&amp;rdquo; setting. Instead, use the &amp;ldquo;Oracle&amp;rdquo; setting. The theme doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.
That fixes the CPU issue, but somewhat annoyingly moves the menu out of the menu bar at the top of the screen and into the application window, a la Windows, making the interface inconsistent with pretty much every other app I use on my Mac.</description>

#!/usr/bin/perl print &amp;#34;Content-type: text/html\n\n&amp;#34;; print `hostname`; 1; Name the file something like hostname.cgi and place it in your web server&amp;rsquo;s /cgi-bin/ directory, or if your web server is configured appropriately, just name it hostname.pl and drop it wherever you like.</description>

      <description>Introduced with Oracle 10gR2, DML Error Logging allows you to make standard SQL INSERT, UPDATE, and MERGE statements behave more like the SQL*Loader utility, logging errors to a table rather than failing and rolling back the first time an error condition is encountered.
The syntax is the same for all DML statements. Just add the following clause to the end of your DML:
LOG ERRORS The database will automatically create an error log table for you.</description>

      <description>I ran into an interesting problem recently when attempting to publish an MS Access application with Citrix XenApp. The application pulled data from an Oracle database, so an ODBC connection was created on the Citrix server. What we found was that when a non-privileged user tried to run the application, the connection failed. When the Citrix server admin ran it, however, it worked. Furthermore, as long as the admin was logged in, anybody else could run the application successfully; when he logged out, the users&amp;rsquo; connections broke again.</description>

      <description>In part one of this series I showed a simple example of how table functions can be used to treat PL/SQL collection types as tables in a SQL query. We used a nested table collection type to which we manually added a few entries. In this example, I intend to show a more practical use of table functions using all three PL/SQL collection types: associative arrays, nested tables, and VARRAYs.</description>

      <description>Yes, they&amp;rsquo;ve been around for a while, but if you haven&amp;rsquo;t made use of table functions lately you might want to reacquaint yourself with this old gem. Table functions allow you to query the contents of PL/SQL collection types using SQL&amp;rsquo;s TABLE operator. Here is a simple example.
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE example AS TYPE nested_table_typ IS TABLE OF VARCHAR2(100); FUNCTION get_nested_table_data RETURN nested_table_typ PIPELINED; END example; / CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY example AS FUNCTION get_nested_table_data RETURN nested_table_typ PIPELINED IS BEGIN PIPE ROW (&amp;#39;one&amp;#39;); PIPE ROW (&amp;#39;two&amp;#39;); PIPE ROW (&amp;#39;three&amp;#39;); RETURN; END get_nested_table_data; END example; / The package function example.</description>

      <description>When writing shell scripts in bash, consider whether your script can be automated in a batch scheduler like cron. If you reference any external resources in your script relative to the directory in which it resides, those references may break when running your script through cron.
By default, crontab runs scripts in the user&amp;rsquo;s home directory, as specified in /etc/passwd. For user &amp;ldquo;Tim&amp;rdquo; with home directory /home/tim, a sample crontab might look something like the following:</description>

      <description>Toplink is a Java framework that maps objects to database tables. It is the reference implementation for the Java Persistence Architecture, or JPA. Developers use Toplink to manage data persistence (storage), queries, and transactions in an Oracle database. By default, Toplink makes use of a special cache called a Session Cache, maintained on the server, which is meant to speed up performance. Queried data is stored in the Session Cache and used in subsequent queries to reduce or eliminate calls to the database.</description>
