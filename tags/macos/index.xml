      <title>Fix High CPU Usage / Memory Leak in SQL Developer 18&#43; for Windows</title>

      <description>If you run SQL Developer on Windows and experience high CPU usage and/or memory leak issues that freeze your PC, then you might want to try disabling some features that are likely causing the problem.
I have personally observed this behavior on every version of SQL Developer since 18.2. Only my PC laptop is affected; my Macbook installation runs fine. I use the prepackaged Java 8 JDK. I have several colleagues who run the same configuration on Windows with no issues at all, so go figure.</description>

      <title>What to do when the Juniper Network Connect app on OS X does not connect</title>
      <link>http://tobybase.com/posts/ewwww/</link>

      <description>If you use Juniper&amp;rsquo;s Network Connect app to connect to your office VPN over HTTPS, you might occasionally experience strange errors like &amp;ldquo;A software error caused the Network Connect tunneling service to terminate.&amp;rdquo; Shortly after that, the application may either crash or prompt you for login credentials again.
The solution involves removing all of the Network Connect files and allowing your browser to download and install the app all over again, as it did the first time you tried to connect to your office VPN.</description>

      <title>How to Use ps to List Top Memory, CPU Eating Processes</title>

      <description>The ps command is a versatile and configurable way to look at the processes running on your system, though I&amp;rsquo;ve generally gotten by with a lazy ps -ef to find out whatever I needed to know. Recently, though, a client&amp;rsquo;s server began running out of memory, and as a number of processes were running on the server, the culprit was not immediately clear. I wanted to provide them with a quick, simple diagnostic tool they could use the next time they received an alert.</description>

      <description>This is an elegant solution for viewing, searching, and archiving man pages that eliminates the necessity for third party apps.
Update: still works in macOS Sierra.</description>

      <title>How to Fix SQL Developer on a Retina Display Mac(book)</title>

      <description>I just purchased a new Macbook Pro 13-inch with Retina Display and was horrified to see how fuzzy SQL Developer looked on the high-res screen. Thanks to Thunderforge on the Stack Overflow forums for this tip:
 Java 7u40 Early Access now supports HiDPI (Retina) displays, as shown by this changelog. So retina support is now available on Java 6, Java 7u40 or higher, and Java 8.
 I am currently running the Early Adopter release of SQL Developer 4.</description>

      <title>Button Hotkeys in SQL Developer on OS X</title>
      <link>http://tobybase.com/posts/2013-01-09-button-hotkeys-in-sql-developer-on-os-x/</link>

      <description>In Windows, most applications provide menu and button accelerator keys that allow you to control the application without having to use a mouse. Java Swing apps like SQL Developer allow you to do the same, ostensibly in a cross-platform compatible manner.
One place I use this frequently is the Enter Binds dialog window that pops up when running a query using bind variables.
In Java 6 on OS X, the hotkey for pressing the Help and Apply buttons was OPTION-H and OPTION-A, respectively.</description>

      <title>Safari 5.1.7 on my MacBookPro OSX 10.7.4 freezes unexpectedly</title>

      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been experiencing strange problems when clicking on links in Safari 5.1.7. Usually the progress indicator would either flash momentarily and do nothing, or else it would never appear at all. Pages would sometimes load, but after an unusual delay and with no indication that the browser was actually doing anything. I switched to Chrome as my default browser for a few days, but that was about all I could stand.</description>

      <title>How To Fix High CPU Usage by SQL Developer on OS X</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been fighting for a couple of years now with an annoying performance bug in SQL Developer for OS X. After using the application for a while CPU usage would spike to around 100%, even when idle. This is a known issue associated with the &amp;ldquo;Look and Feel&amp;rdquo; preference.
Basically, don&amp;rsquo;t use the &amp;ldquo;Mac OS X&amp;rdquo; setting. Instead, use the &amp;ldquo;Oracle&amp;rdquo; setting. The theme doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.
That fixes the CPU issue, but somewhat annoyingly moves the menu out of the menu bar at the top of the screen and into the application window, a la Windows, making the interface inconsistent with pretty much every other app I use on my Mac.</description>

      <description>Need to run your company&amp;rsquo;s Oracle Forms application from your Mac, and can&amp;rsquo;t? Annoyed with having to crank up a virtual machine for just that one task? Even with the latest published Java version for OS X (1.6.0_33, as of today), you may find that some of the newer Forms applications just won&amp;rsquo;t run. Well, fret no longer. A solution may already be here, at least for Safari and Firefox.</description>

      <description>One of the great things about working for Enkitec is that it&amp;rsquo;s a very Mac-friendly shop. When I arrived there in 2007 there were a handful of us running Macs and the attitude at the top seemed to be respectful, but skeptical. They allowed me to use my own laptop, which at the time was a 15-inch Intel Core2 Duo Macbook Pro, with the understanding that I could request a standard-issue Dell laptop at any time should the need arise.</description>
