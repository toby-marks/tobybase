      <title>How to Restore Files From a Previous Version in Git/Github</title>
      <link>http://tobybase.com/posts/how-to-recover-a-prior-version-on-github/</link>

      <description>Get the hash of the &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; version you want to recover You first need to identify where things went wrong. Then get the commit identifier (also called the hash) for the version immediately prior to that. (Also make sure you&amp;rsquo;re pulling from the appropriate branch; for simplicity&amp;rsquo;s sake, this example assumes all changes are being committed to the master branch.)

      <description>[NOTE: problem identified on my personal laptop with macOS 10.15.2, Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client 4.6.03049]
What to Do When You Encounter This Error  AnyConnect cannot confirm it is connected to your secure gateway. The local network may not be trustworthy. Please try another network.
 This is a potentially misleading explanation, as the problem in my case was due to a corrupted VPN certificate.
To fix the problem on macOS, do the following.</description>

      <title>Fix High CPU Usage / Memory Leak in SQL Developer 18&#43; for Windows</title>
      <link>http://tobybase.com/posts/sqldev-memory-leak/</link>

      <description>If you run SQL Developer on Windows and experience high CPU usage and/or memory leak issues that freeze your PC, then you might want to try disabling some features that are likely causing the problem.
I have personally observed this behavior on every version of SQL Developer since 18.2. Only my PC laptop is affected; my Macbook installation runs fine. I use the prepackaged Java 8 JDK. I have several colleagues who run the same configuration on Windows with no issues at all, so go figure.</description>

      <title>What to do when the Juniper Network Connect app on OS X does not connect</title>
      <link>http://tobybase.com/posts/ewwww/</link>

      <description>If you use Juniper&amp;rsquo;s Network Connect app to connect to your office VPN over HTTPS, you might occasionally experience strange errors like &amp;ldquo;A software error caused the Network Connect tunneling service to terminate.&amp;rdquo; Shortly after that, the application may either crash or prompt you for login credentials again.
The solution involves removing all of the Network Connect files and allowing your browser to download and install the app all over again, as it did the first time you tried to connect to your office VPN.</description>

      <title>How to Fix SQL Developer on a Retina Display Mac(book)</title>

      <description>I just purchased a new Macbook Pro 13-inch with Retina Display and was horrified to see how fuzzy SQL Developer looked on the high-res screen. Thanks to Thunderforge on the Stack Overflow forums for this tip:
 Java 7u40 Early Access now supports HiDPI (Retina) displays, as shown by this changelog. So retina support is now available on Java 6, Java 7u40 or higher, and Java 8.
 I am currently running the Early Adopter release of SQL Developer 4.</description>

      <title>Button Hotkeys in SQL Developer on OS X</title>
      <link>http://tobybase.com/posts/2013-01-09-button-hotkeys-in-sql-developer-on-os-x/</link>

      <description>In Windows, most applications provide menu and button accelerator keys that allow you to control the application without having to use a mouse. Java Swing apps like SQL Developer allow you to do the same, ostensibly in a cross-platform compatible manner.
One place I use this frequently is the Enter Binds dialog window that pops up when running a query using bind variables.
In Java 6 on OS X, the hotkey for pressing the Help and Apply buttons was OPTION-H and OPTION-A, respectively.</description>

      <title>How To Fix High CPU Usage by SQL Developer on OS X</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been fighting for a couple of years now with an annoying performance bug in SQL Developer for OS X. After using the application for a while CPU usage would spike to around 100%, even when idle. This is a known issue associated with the &amp;ldquo;Look and Feel&amp;rdquo; preference.
Basically, don&amp;rsquo;t use the &amp;ldquo;Mac OS X&amp;rdquo; setting. Instead, use the &amp;ldquo;Oracle&amp;rdquo; setting. The theme doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.
That fixes the CPU issue, but somewhat annoyingly moves the menu out of the menu bar at the top of the screen and into the application window, a la Windows, making the interface inconsistent with pretty much every other app I use on my Mac.</description>

      <description>One of the great things about working for Enkitec is that it&amp;rsquo;s a very Mac-friendly shop. When I arrived there in 2007 there were a handful of us running Macs and the attitude at the top seemed to be respectful, but skeptical. They allowed me to use my own laptop, which at the time was a 15-inch Intel Core2 Duo Macbook Pro, with the understanding that I could request a standard-issue Dell laptop at any time should the need arise.</description>
