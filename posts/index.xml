      <title>3 Tips for Running SAS Queries on Oracle</title>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know a whole lot about SAS, but on my current gig I am frequently called upon to tune queries that run in that environment. Here are three things I have learned to keep in mind as a SAS developer when running against Oracle database.
Use PRESERVE_COMMENTS This is most critical. In Oracle, SQL hints are specified in a specially formatted inline comment. Running a query or DML statement without those hints could be detrimental to performance.</description>

      <title>Fix High CPU Usage / Memory Leak in SQL Developer 18&#43; for Windows</title>
      <link>http://tobybase.com/posts/sqldev-memory-leak/</link>

      <description>If you run SQL Developer on Windows and experience high CPU usage and/or memory leak issues that freeze your PC, then you might want to try disabling some features that are likely causing the problem.
I have personally observed this behavior on every version of SQL Developer since 18.2. Only my PC laptop is affected; my Macbook installation runs fine. I use the prepackaged Java 8 JDK. I have several colleagues who run the same configuration on Windows with no issues at all, so go figure.</description>

      <description>Welcome one and all to my new professional blog, tobybase.com. My name is Toby Marks and I work as a Oracle Consultant at Infolob Solutions in Irving, Texas. My old blog is still up on Tumblr, and there are a few items there that folks still find useful. Most of the content is a bit dated, though, as I&amp;rsquo;ve been out of the blogging game for a while.
This is my attempt to turn that around.</description>

      <title>What to do when the Juniper Network Connect app on OS X does not connect</title>

      <description>If you use Juniper&amp;rsquo;s Network Connect app to connect to your office VPN over HTTPS, you might occasionally experience strange errors like &amp;ldquo;A software error caused the Network Connect tunneling service to terminate.&amp;rdquo; Shortly after that, the application may either crash or prompt you for login credentials again.
The solution involves removing all of the Network Connect files and allowing your browser to download and install the app all over again, as it did the first time you tried to connect to your office VPN.</description>

      <title>How to Use ps to List Top Memory, CPU Eating Processes</title>

      <description>The ps command is a versatile and configurable way to look at the processes running on your system, though I&amp;rsquo;ve generally gotten by with a lazy ps -ef to find out whatever I needed to know. Recently, though, a client&amp;rsquo;s server began running out of memory, and as a number of processes were running on the server, the culprit was not immediately clear. I wanted to provide them with a quick, simple diagnostic tool they could use the next time they received an alert.</description>

      <description>I just purchased a new Macbook Pro 13-inch with Retina Display and was horrified to see how fuzzy SQL Developer looked on the high-res screen. Thanks to Thunderforge on the Stack Overflow forums for this tip:
 Java 7u40 Early Access now supports HiDPI (Retina) displays, as shown by this changelog. So retina support is now available on Java 6, Java 7u40 or higher, and Java 8.
 I am currently running the Early Adopter release of SQL Developer 4.</description>

      <description>Under normal circumstances, it is fairly easy in Microsoft Word to reset page numbering when starting a new section of your document. However, such a simple thing can be non-trivial when dealing with the BI Publisher Template Builder plugin for Microsoft Office (available from Oracle ‚Äî see BI Publisher Desktop).
In short, doing this the normal way did not work for me, and in researching the issue I ran across a number of folks who were having the same problem.</description>

      <title>Button Hotkeys in SQL Developer on OS X</title>

      <guid>http://tobybase.com/posts/2013-01-09-button-hotkeys-in-sql-developer-on-os-x/</guid>
      <description>In Windows, most applications provide menu and button accelerator keys that allow you to control the application without having to use a mouse. Java Swing apps like SQL Developer allow you to do the same, ostensibly in a cross-platform compatible manner.
One place I use this frequently is the Enter Binds dialog window that pops up when running a query using bind variables.
In Java 6 on OS X, the hotkey for pressing the Help and Apply buttons was OPTION-H and OPTION-A, respectively.</description>

      <title>How To Use SQL to Query an XML Document Using Oracle External Tables</title>

      <description>Oracle&amp;rsquo;s external table feature allows you to treat structured files on the database server as tables for query and DML purposes. To use an example from the linked documentation, a tab-delimited file like this:
56 november, 15, 1980 baker mary alice 09/01/2004 87 december, 20, 1970 roper lisa marie 01/01/1999 &amp;hellip;could be queried like this:
SELECT employee_number, employee_first_name, substr(employee_middle_name, 1, 1), employee_last_name, employee_hire_date, to_date(employee_dob,&amp;#39;month, dd, yyyy&amp;#39;) FROM employees; After defining the external table like this:</description>

      <description>In my last post I described how to configure BI Publisher to authenticate against an LDAP server, typically a corporate Active Directory server. Aside from authentication, you can also use LDAP group membership to determine who has access to a given report. Here&amp;rsquo;s how you do it.
 Create a group in your LDAP/AD directory and assign your target users to that group. Revisit your LDAP authentication settings. These are located on the Admin Tab, on the Security Configuration page.</description>

   Setting Example Value     URL ldap://ad.mycompany.com:389 Your company&amp;rsquo;s LDAP server and port.   Administrator Username CN=ADMIN,OU=Users,OU=Shared Services,DC=mycompany,DC=com The fully qualified DN of the account you use to sign in to LDAP.

      <description>Occasionally when debugging my Javascript code I need to be able to analyze the properties of an unknown object; for instance, an unexpected DOM object passed to an event handler. How do you analyze the properties of an object when you don&amp;rsquo;t know what the object is? I was looking for a way to list all the properties of a generic Javascript or DOM object when I stumbled across this blog post by Andrew Peters.</description>

      <description>You can get this error if you are trying to schedule a report and your BI Publisher installation uses LDAP authentication.
To avoid it, make sure that the &amp;ldquo;Administrator&amp;rdquo; account you use to connect to your LDAP server is in the XMLP_ADMIN group. The LDAP settings are located on the Admin tab, under Security Settings / Security Configuration.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been fighting for a couple of years now with an annoying performance bug in SQL Developer for OS X. After using the application for a while CPU usage would spike to around 100%, even when idle. This is a known issue associated with the &amp;ldquo;Look and Feel&amp;rdquo; preference.
Basically, don&amp;rsquo;t use the &amp;ldquo;Mac OS X&amp;rdquo; setting. Instead, use the &amp;ldquo;Oracle&amp;rdquo; setting. The theme doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.
That fixes the CPU issue, but somewhat annoyingly moves the menu out of the menu bar at the top of the screen and into the application window, a la Windows, making the interface inconsistent with pretty much every other app I use on my Mac.</description>

      <description>Here is a short and simple Perl CGI script that you can use to expose the hostname of your web server, as opposed to just the server/domain portion of the URL string:
#!/usr/bin/perl print &amp;#34;Content-type: text/html\n\n&amp;#34;; print `hostname`; 1; Name the file something like hostname.cgi and place it in your web server&amp;rsquo;s /cgi-bin/ directory, or if your web server is configured appropriately, just name it hostname.pl and drop it wherever you like.</description>

      <description>One of the great things about working for Enkitec is that it&amp;rsquo;s a very Mac-friendly shop. When I arrived there in 2007 there were a handful of us running Macs and the attitude at the top seemed to be respectful, but skeptical. They allowed me to use my own laptop, which at the time was a 15-inch Intel Core2 Duo Macbook Pro, with the understanding that I could request a standard-issue Dell laptop at any time should the need arise.</description>

      <description>Introduced with Oracle 10gR2, DML Error Logging allows you to make standard SQL INSERT, UPDATE, and MERGE statements behave more like the SQL*Loader utility, logging errors to a table rather than failing and rolling back the first time an error condition is encountered.
The syntax is the same for all DML statements. Just add the following clause to the end of your DML:
LOG ERRORS  The database will automatically create an error log table for you.</description>

      <description>I ran into an interesting problem recently when attempting to publish an MS Access application with Citrix XenApp. The application pulled data from an Oracle database, so an ODBC connection was created on the Citrix server. What we found was that when a non-privileged user tried to run the application, the connection failed. When the Citrix server admin ran it, however, it worked. Furthermore, as long as the admin was logged in, anybody else could run the application successfully; when he logged out, the users&amp;rsquo; connections broke again.</description>

      <description>At my current client I am responsible for administering a third-party Java appplication that unfortunately generates a lot of performance complaints. It&amp;rsquo;s a multi-tiered system with the middle-tier running on Oracle Appication Server 10.1.3. I am already familiar with GUI profiling tools like jconsole and jvisualvm, both of which are included with Oracle&amp;rsquo;s JDK, and I have played around with the profiling capabilities in NetBeans. All of these profiling tools are fairly similar to one another in look and functionality.</description>

      <description>In part one of this series I showed a simple example of how table functions can be used to treat PL/SQL collection types as tables in a SQL query. We used a nested table collection type to which we manually added a few entries. In this example, I intend to show a more practical use of table functions using all three PL/SQL collection types: associative arrays, nested tables, and VARRAYs.</description>

      <description>Yes, they&amp;rsquo;ve been around for a while, but if you haven&amp;rsquo;t made use of table functions lately you might want to reacquaint yourself with this old gem. Table functions allow you to query the contents of PL/SQL collection types using SQL&amp;rsquo;s TABLE operator. Here is a simple example.
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE example AS TYPE nested_table_typ IS TABLE OF VARCHAR2(100); FUNCTION get_nested_table_data RETURN nested_table_typ PIPELINED; END example; / CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY example AS FUNCTION get_nested_table_data RETURN nested_table_typ PIPELINED IS BEGIN PIPE ROW (&amp;#39;one&amp;#39;); PIPE ROW (&amp;#39;two&amp;#39;); PIPE ROW (&amp;#39;three&amp;#39;); RETURN; END get_nested_table_data; END example; / The package function example.</description>

      <description>When writing shell scripts in bash, consider whether your script can be automated in a batch scheduler like cron. If you reference any external resources in your script relative to the directory in which it resides, those references may break when running your script through cron.
By default, crontab runs scripts in the user&amp;rsquo;s home directory, as specified in /etc/passwd. For user &amp;ldquo;Tim&amp;rdquo; with home directory /home/tim, a sample crontab might look something like the following:</description>

      <description>Toplink is a Java framework that maps objects to database tables. It is the reference implementation for the Java Persistence Architecture, or JPA. Developers use Toplink to manage data persistence (storage), queries, and transactions in an Oracle database. By default, Toplink makes use of a special cache called a Session Cache, maintained on the server, which is meant to speed up performance. Queried data is stored in the Session Cache and used in subsequent queries to reduce or eliminate calls to the database.</description>
