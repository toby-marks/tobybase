      <description>Welcome one and all to my new professional blog, tobybase.com. My name is Toby Marks and I work as a Oracle Consultant at Infolob Solutions in Irving, Texas. My old blog is still up on Tumblr, and there are a few items there that folks still find useful. Most of the content is a bit dated, though, as I&amp;rsquo;ve been out of the blogging game for a while.
This is my attempt to turn that around.</description>
