      <description>I just purchased a new Macbook Pro 13-inch with Retina Display and was horrified to see how fuzzy SQL Developer looked on the high-res screen. Thanks to Thunderforge on the Stack Overflow forums for this tip:
 Java 7u40 Early Access now supports HiDPI (Retina) displays, as shown by this changelog. So retina support is now available on Java 6, Java 7u40 or higher, and Java 8.
 I am currently running the Early Adopter release of SQL Developer 4.</description>

      <title>How To Reset Page Numbering Between Document Sections in BI Publisher&#39;s Template Builder for Word</title>

      <description>Under normal circumstances, it is fairly easy in Microsoft Word to reset page numbering when starting a new section of your document. However, such a simple thing can be non-trivial when dealing with the BI Publisher Template Builder plugin for Microsoft Office (available from Oracle ‚Äî see BI Publisher Desktop).
In short, doing this the normal way did not work for me, and in researching the issue I ran across a number of folks who were having the same problem.</description>

      <title>Button Hotkeys in SQL Developer on OS X</title>

      <description>In Windows, most applications provide menu and button accelerator keys that allow you to control the application without having to use a mouse. Java Swing apps like SQL Developer allow you to do the same, ostensibly in a cross-platform compatible manner.
One place I use this frequently is the Enter Binds dialog window that pops up when running a query using bind variables.
In Java 6 on OS X, the hotkey for pressing the Help and Apply buttons was OPTION-H and OPTION-A, respectively.</description>

      <title>How To Restrict Access to BI Publisher Reports</title>

      <description>In my last post I described how to configure BI Publisher to authenticate against an LDAP server, typically a corporate Active Directory server. Aside from authentication, you can also use LDAP group membership to determine who has access to a given report. Here&amp;rsquo;s how you do it.
 Create a group in your LDAP/AD directory and assign your target users to that group. Revisit your LDAP authentication settings. These are located on the Admin Tab, on the Security Configuration page.</description>

      <description>Log in to BI Publisher as an administrator. Click on the Admin tab. Click on Security Configuration. For Security Model, choose LDAP and enter the following parameters:
   Setting Example Value     URL ldap://ad.mycompany.com:389 Your company&amp;rsquo;s LDAP server and port.

      <title>How to Avoid the &#34;Job scheduling failed because the user has no permission to access this report&#34; Error in BI Publisher</title>

      <description>You can get this error if you are trying to schedule a report and your BI Publisher installation uses LDAP authentication.
To avoid it, make sure that the &amp;ldquo;Administrator&amp;rdquo; account you use to connect to your LDAP server is in the XMLP_ADMIN group. The LDAP settings are located on the Admin tab, under Security Settings / Security Configuration.</description>

      <title>How To Fix High CPU Usage by SQL Developer on OS X</title>
      <link>http://tobybase.com/posts/2012-07-20-easy-fix-for-high-cpu-usage-in-sql-developer-on-os-x/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been fighting for a couple of years now with an annoying performance bug in SQL Developer for OS X. After using the application for a while CPU usage would spike to around 100%, even when idle. This is a known issue associated with the &amp;ldquo;Look and Feel&amp;rdquo; preference.
Basically, don&amp;rsquo;t use the &amp;ldquo;Mac OS X&amp;rdquo; setting. Instead, use the &amp;ldquo;Oracle&amp;rdquo; setting. The theme doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.
That fixes the CPU issue, but somewhat annoyingly moves the menu out of the menu bar at the top of the screen and into the application window, a la Windows, making the interface inconsistent with pretty much every other app I use on my Mac.</description>
