      <description>(The following is adapted from the official Photon OS FAQ.)
How do I transfer or share files between #Photon and my host machine? Use vmhgfs-fuse to transfer files between Photon and your host machine:
  Enable Shared folders in the Workstation or Fusion UI (edit the VM settings and choose Options-&amp;gt;Enabled shared folders).
  Make sure open-vm-tools is installed (it is installed by default in the Minimal installation and OVA import).</description>

      <title>How to Configure Static Networking in a Linux VM</title>

      <description>I originally had this requirement after creating a new persistent linux virtual machine in OVM that needed static addressing. This is just standard linux setup, though, and can be adapted to both virtual and physical machines.
Turn on Networking # sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network Make sure networking is enabled and configure the hostname.
NETWORKING=yes HOSTNAME=myhost.mycompany.local Configure the Network Interface # sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 Here is a sample config for static IPs.</description>
